PebbleBucks 2.0
===============

PebbleBucks is an app for the [Pebble Smartwatch](https://getpebble.com) that allows easy access to your Starbucks barcode and account information, including your dollar ballance, free drink count, count of drinks until your next free drink, and last updated date. A short press of the select button updates the account information from Starbucks while a long press toggles the barcode orientation.

Based on [PebbleBucks 2.0 by Neal](https://github.com/Neal/PebbleBucks) and the [original PebbleBucks by matt Donders](https://github.com/mattdonders/PebbleBucks).
Idea and images are from the original PebbleBucks by mattdonders.

___*___ The above barcode was generated with a random 16-digit number. If it turns out that this random 16-digit code is a valid Starbucks card number, whoops and sorry.

## Getting Started

* Download and install the watch app from the [Releases](https://github.com/a2/PebbleBucks/releases) page.
* Configure the watchapp with your card number and Starbucks login credentials.

## Wait, what are you going to do with my data?

### Card Number

The card number is used to generate a barcode for use at Starbucks by a script that runs locally on your phone. This barcode is transmitted to your Pebble watch and is not saved anywhere else.

### Starbucks Credentials

Your Starbucks login credentials are stored on your phone. They are only transferred to the Starbucks server using the secure HTTPS protocol.
